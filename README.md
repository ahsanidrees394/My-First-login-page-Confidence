# My-First-login-page-Confidence
This login page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a stylish background, a bold header, and a centered form box. Users can toggle between sign-up and sign-in modes, where the name field appears or hides smoothly. Input fields use icons for clarity, while buttons switch modes with clear active and disabled styles.
